# AutoTagsCRISPR
Building a pipeline for automated CRISPR construct design in Drosophila Melanogaster.

Data is organised from input files with gene IDs, reference genome sequences and annotations, and all potential guideRNA sequences. 
The best guide RNA is chosen for the given parameters, and primers are designed for the left and right homology arms of this region,
as well as two verification primers outside of this region.
