* Have a roughly compiled complete file
* Need to add: check chromosome for guide RNA, adapt BLAST for .py, primers section into functions, plus a BLAST check of the guide RNAs
* Now have tests for functions

* Note - doesn't run well when checking for 1+ matches for BLAST - maybe this is due to multiple copies in the genome
